# Chicago Crime Analyzer

## **Project Overview**
The Chicago Crime Analyzer project aims to analyze and visualize crime data from Chicago, providing insights into crime patterns, trends, and hotspots. The analysis helps stakeholders such as law enforcement, policymakers, and the general public make informed decisions about crime prevention and resource allocation.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, invalid dates, and duplicate entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examines crime types, trends, and severity distribution.
- **Visualization**: Generates detailed visual insights into crime patterns using Power BI and Python.
- **Export for Power BI/Tableau**: Saves cleaned datasets for advanced dashboard creation.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating dynamic dashboards and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running the analysis.
